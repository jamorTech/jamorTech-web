          Many recent technology graduates are looking for opportunities to both
          exhibit their talents and continue their learning path through
          employment. However, the harsh fact is that, due to their lack of
          practical experience, their prospects of landing a job are small. It
          is crucial to emphasise that this is not the fault of the firms they
          want to work for; these organisations are just as eager to hire highly
          qualified people to carry out their jobs quickly and, ideally, lower
          their recruiting costs.
